Chapter 1 and 8 doesn't have any code.

Installing all the software and following the steps to get proper output is mandatory. Later, you can try the following process to get the output.

To run the code, you can simply run it inside the Python console, after following the installation and other process mentioned in the book, or, if you have python installed in your Windows system, you can run the code files from the Command Prompt by providing the path where you have stored your .py files, for example, if you name your Python code file as example.py and save it on your desktop, type 

1) cd C:\Path to the file saved on your Desktop

2 python example.py.

If there are 2 different versions of Python installed on your Windows system, say Python 2.x and Python 3.x, then try the following:

1) python 2.x example.py

OR

1) python 3.x example.py

Hope this proves helpful.
